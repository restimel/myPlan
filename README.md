## Purpose

**myPLAN** is a tool designed to assist judges in **lead sport climbing competitions** with planning and visualizing climbing routes.

It is designed to work seamlessly on both **mobile** and **desktop** devices.

### Features

* Import or take a picture of the climbing wall.

* Add handhold values directly onto the image.
    * Holds can be **added or removed** at any time — values are automatically re-calculated.
    * Holds are **freely movable** after placement.
    * Holds can be **doubled**.
    * Multiple holds can be **linked** to share the same value.

* Export the route as an image to share with the **Jury President** or other judges (e.g., the video judge).
